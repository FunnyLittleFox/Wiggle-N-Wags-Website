# Wiggle-N-Wags-Website
A private build for business website

This is me just playing around with what I've learned in class.  Been meaning to get my website back up and running for my small business.  I figured
this was a way to put what I've learned into practice and get a website up and running all at the same time as well as something that I may be able to 
use as a portfolio piece for the future.
